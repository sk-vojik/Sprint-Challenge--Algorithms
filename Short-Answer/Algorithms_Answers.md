Exercise I.

A). 
This algorithim is O(n^3). The while condition has n * n * n, which is n^3

B).
This algorithim is O(n^4). There are four nested for loops, so n * n * n * n

C).
This algorithim is just O(n). It is recursive, and decrease by 1 each time, so it is linear, or a 1:1 ratio of input to output.
